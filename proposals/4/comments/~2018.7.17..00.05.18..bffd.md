## `~littel-ponnys`
We now have the state machine version of Ford-turbo compiling, along with
several of the simple tests passing. We got up to `+test-live-and-once` before
we realized that we had to add a duct multiplexing layer. While we thought that
we could strongly bind builds to ducts, we need a way of saying that multiple
ducts depend on a blocked scry. For completeness, we started on doing the same
deduplication on Clay subscriptions, too.
