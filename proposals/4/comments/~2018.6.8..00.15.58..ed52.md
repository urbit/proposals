## `~littel-ponnys`
Ford-turbo enabled Gall boots when a new pill is `+solid`ed. Ford-turbo enabled

`%hall`. Ford-turbo enabled Gall reloads apps. [WIP

[workarounds](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/commit/8bae06dbcb81821e6e247f61f92696868c5cd7b6)
for now. Filed as [arvo#994](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/issues/994).)
