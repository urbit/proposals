## `~littel-ponnys`
~littel-ponnys got the `%walk` schematic to the point where it is
recursively loading the `%/mar` directory. Building a graph from
this data is up next. [Current WIP](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/commit/181d5a7b2eb10149742c2645bd1d0024996feb61).

~rovnys-ricfer continued to work on the new caching system,
fixing the bug from yesterday. (He now has all new bugs!)
