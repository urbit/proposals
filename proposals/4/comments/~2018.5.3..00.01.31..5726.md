## `~littel-ponnys`
Today, I implemented the `%slit` schematic along with tests for it; it is on the main branch.

I started on implementing the `%call` schematic, but didn't finish before the end of the day. It's on [this WIP branch](https://github.com/eglaysher/arvo/commit/731997f64a2957077a35c21f82360d8c720961f5).
