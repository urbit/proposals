## `~littel-ponnys`
Today, I completed the clay integration by making clay just give us dates in
`%wris`. I also then went and implemented `%dude` and a stripped down version
of `%hood` which can't deal with `+crane`s.

~rovnys finished implementing the `%path` schematic.

The next thing to do is to implement the basic version of `%core`, which is how
we compile hoon files to real Urbit executables. From there, we can add imports
and other `+crane`s.
