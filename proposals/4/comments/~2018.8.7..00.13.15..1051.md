## `~littel-ponnys`
~ponnys got an [end-to-end rendering of
collections](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/commit/00a32ffe73b00748549cd7c3261a09e8e671d26c)
using Eyre and Ford-turbo. This means that all three of the Ford builds
involved in building a page are now done with Ford-turbo. Afterwards, he tried
to look at compiling the `%collections` app with Ford-turbo in an attempt to
get the entire app working on the branch, but ran into the previous problems
with `bail: fail` errors when trying to compile `%hall`.

~rovnys worked on debugging slowness in the compiler.
