## `~rovnys-ricfer`
`~littel` moved the `+clock` and `+capped-queue` data structures from Ford to Zuse and added unit tests, fixing a couple bugs in the process. Not committed yet.

`~rovnys` began adding tests to Clay, in preparation for fixing a bug we encountered where Clay can violate referential transparency if multiple writes are performed during a single Arvo event. The quick fix for this will be limiting each Arvo event to a single Clay write. Subsequent write requests during that event will be enqueued, and Clay will set a Behn timer to create a new event that will run immediately afterward to process the next write request, until its queue is empty. Also not committed yet.
