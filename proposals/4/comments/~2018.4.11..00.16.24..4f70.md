Addendum to the previous post:
In `+reduce`, we also need to copy listeners downward from build to sub-builds.

Today we got most of the sketch of how `+gather` and `+make` should work. It doesn't compile yet, but we did write what we believe to be the entire `+gather` function. `+make` has been mostly switched over, but still needs to have its dependency tracking moved to `+reduce`, which has not been implemented at all.

Latest work is at [this git commit](https://github.com/belisarius222/arvo/commit/6516b20d2d4e829d28ce67400bb1a66fb594a680).
