## `~littel-ponnys`
Much more of collections works compared to yesterday: you can create a circle
and post to it, though you can't yet post a comment to on someone's post
because of what might be a Ford error.

~rovnys fixed the testing framework so that it can report compile failures to
the user. He then deleted a deprecated library which was previously used in the
testing framework, along with fixing up the few other places it was
used. Ford's tests now also run inside `+test`.
