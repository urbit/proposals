## `~littel-ponnys`
Today, we got about four more unit tests to pass.

We've been having some trouble achieving correctness with Clay subscriptions on
live builds. We have an idea for an improved design that should at least get us
to correctness for live builds on the local ship.

Each live listener (duct) is attached to a root `+build` and maintains its own
Clay subscriptions. This build may contain live (unpinned) `%scry` builds as
sub-builds. For each live listener, we track a `(jug disc resource)` where the
`+resource` values are the targets of the `%scry` sub-builds. Each time the
root build completes, we make a new Clay subscription on each `[disc (set
resource)]` key-value pair.

Using this scheme, we need to make sure that when we get a response on one
duct, we don't promote the results of `%scry` builds that were only tracked by
other ducts. Otherwise, we could erroneously promote a changed `%scry` whose
change we hadn't yet heard about because Clay responds one subscription at a
time, so we'll only hear about the change in the next `%take` event.
