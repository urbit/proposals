## `~rosfyl-sammeb-boltun-radwex--fannec-dabsub-binwyd-dopzod`
Today, we figured out the one dependency problem we observed when we started using Ford-turbo from Gall. We were not properly rebuilding clients of an old rebuild of an old rebuild. This meant that some apps failed to reload when one of the libraries that app depended on was modified. We fixed that bug by making the process recursive and added a test.

We also redesigned the caching system, but have not yet implemented it. In the new version, instead of deleting a root build when it loses its duct, we move ownership of the root build to a `+cache`. This cache is a simple LRU of the last 128 items (number to be tuned later). We weren't sure about the cache wiping semantics. There are two options:

- Turn the older half of the results into tombstones.
- First try to delete half the cache. If the cache is empty, then tombstone half the results instead.
