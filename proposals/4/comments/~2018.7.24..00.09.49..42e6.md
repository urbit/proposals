## `~littel-ponnys`
Having completed making the state machine version of Ford-turbo work against
the test suite, we did several queued tasks. We reworked how
`%pin`/`%same`/`%dude` worked so that they didn't show up in the
`+build-result`. This should help with the build cache. We also changed the
top-level `%build` interface so it takes an explicit `live=?` bit so that we
don't have to infer whether a build is live or not. This gives callers to ford
more control over caching build artifacts. We also fixed a bug where we never
canceled `%scry`s when the user `%kill`ed a build.

From there, ~rovnys and ~ponnys split off to work on different things: ~rovnys
is going back to cache work and ~ponnys is going back to system integration
tasks.
