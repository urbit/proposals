## `~rovnys-ricfer`
All the tests we had passed, which means live builds, blocked builds, and rebuilds are working at least approximately correctly.  We added testing for +cancel, and it turns out it's broken for live rebuilds, so now we're debugging that. Latest work can be found [here](https://github.com/belisarius222/arvo/tree/f9c15662bd856b7c1fa5597b9678f4ccdbe46e96).

Once we get this test to pass, we'll add more aggressive test cases, including a simulacrum of the fora sidebar, to make sure the rebuild logic is solid. Once we're convinced live and once builds work correctly, including doing the right cache promotion, then we'll implement the cache reclamation system. Then we'll start implementing the rest of the schematics.
