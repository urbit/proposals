## `~littel-ponnys`
Today, we completed the big merge with Curtis. Curtis merged his language
change branch into our `ford-turbo` branch. ~ponnys then fixed tests, made the
system boot with `%hall` and `%talk` turned on, and worked with Curtis to fix
some regressions around the type system. He then integrated in the
`collections` branch and got the front page of collections working again.

~rovnys spend much of the day building the primary cache for Ford. What we've
been using for expedience is a secondary compiler cache, which is a
content-addressable cache of compiler operations, i.e. given a `+hoon`, what's
the resulting nock? But we also need to have a primary cache which is a
straight FIFO queue of previous builds that we completed. This new primary
cache now passes tests.
