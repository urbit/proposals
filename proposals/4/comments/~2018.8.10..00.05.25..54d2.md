## `~littel-ponnys`
Today, ~ponnys did more integration work, merging in the collections-redesign
branch. The `%collections`, `%acme`, and `%dns` apps now start at boot. The
merged branch is
[here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/commit/dded51f0cd164df07f0fea1b0f4b95b6ee0abbc6).

I also looked into moving the `+ford-turbo` test generator over to the `+test`
framework. I quickly ran into the same problem where it couldn't tell between
compile failure and test non-existence. The test framework should probably have
an overhaul before more weight is placed on it. :-/
