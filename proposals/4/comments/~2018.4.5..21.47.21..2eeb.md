Next up is an approximate reproduction of the five-o-fora problem, using just `%ride` and autocons schematics (this is why we implemented the `%ride` schematic).

We'll have two "fora posts," each of which will be a `%scry` producing a noun whose type is `[title=@tas contents=tape]`. These fora posts will be transformed through a "renderer" step that will create a sidebar consisting of the titles of each fora post. Each title will be obtained by running a `%ride` schematic on a fora post that produces just the title of the post. The sidebar will be an autocons of the two titles. The "rendered" fora posts will each be an autocons of the original post and the sidebar.

The test will then inject a new version of one of the fora posts, but only change its contents, not its title. Ford must only rebuild that fora post, its title, and the rendered version of that post, and must not touch the sidebar or the other fora post.
