## `~rovnys-ricfer`
We made some progress implementing the new `%pin` schematic, including separating out the two conditional branches in `+start-build` (`+start-live-build` and `+start-once-build`) and two fully tested helper arms, `+date-from-schematic` to determine the latest `%pin` within a schematic, and `+is-schematic-live`, which will produce yes if the schematic contains a `%scry` schematic that is not under a `%pin`. 

We figured out the persistent data structures (again) for this new scheme.

We determined we did not have to change the live listener promotion in `+execute`. We updated `+cancel` to recursively delete the listener from the build and its sub-builds.

Next steps:
- Special-case the `%pin` schematic in `+execute` to store the build at `date.schematic` instead of the original `date.build`.
- Implement `%pin` handler in `+make`.
- Remove `%clay-once` and `%gall-once` `+dependency` sub-types.
- Use liveness in `+make` of a `%scry` schematic to determine whether engage in live tracking for that build, including the information that will later be used to send a Clay subscription (the original reason for this redesign).
- Get tests passing again.
- Move back from the `ford-turbo-wip` branches to `ford-turbo` in the main Arvo repo.
