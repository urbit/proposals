## `~rovnys-ricfer`
We have now implemented sending `%made` moves for future rebuilds, which handles the case where we've unblocked and completed an old live build.

We also added an identity schematic: the `%same` schematic, which passes through the result of its input schematic unchanged. This is intended to be used in accordance with the new `%pin` behavior:

Now the way to tell Ford that a build is once (not live) is to wrap the entire schematic in a `%pin`. If there isn't a `%pin` at the root of a schematic, the build is live. This means that even an autocons of two pinned schematics will be considered live. This is intended to follow the principle of least surprise: if you're sending Ford a series of once builds, you should pin them all. If you're sending a series of live builds, none of them should be pinned.

But what if you wanted to send Ford a pinned build but have Ford cache the result until you unsubscribe from it? This can happen if you're sending Ford a series of live builds, but one of them happens to be trivial, so the whole thing is pinned. In that case, you can wrap the build in a `%same`. When Ford receives the request, there is now a `%same` at the top level, not a `%pin`, so the build is live.

Feedback on the new schematics would be appreciated.
