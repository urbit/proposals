## `~littel-ponnys`
The ford re-re-redesign continues.

We now have a separate index of `(map duct duct-state)`, where `+duct-state`
keeps track of what the build for a duct is, whether it's been run live, and
dates and subscriptions associated with it. Clients are also now organized
per-duct, along with the rebuild algorithm.
