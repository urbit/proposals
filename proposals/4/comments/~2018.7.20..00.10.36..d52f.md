## `~littel-ponnys`
Today, we got tests passing up through `+test-five-oh-fora`. We had to fix some
problems with how we were doing accounting of subscriptions (we were leaving
null sets around!) and clients (we were not properly removing clients).

But now we have Ford-turbo passing at least up to our first complicated
multi-build scenario.
