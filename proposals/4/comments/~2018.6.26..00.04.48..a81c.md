## `~littel-ponnys`
Today I redid the `%cast` schematic so that it would use the `%walk`
schematic. I then added a new cast unit test which used the big mark graph I
generated for the `%walk` test. I fixed up all the remaining issues with the
previous unit tests, as they now all depended on `%cy` on various directories.

When trying to integrate this into a live ship, clay stopped working. This is
because we are now compiling all the code in `%/mar`, which is also pulling in
large portions of `%/sur` and `%/lib`. It turns out we never implemented the
indirect hoon syntax. `//` is not a horn, but a specialized thing which
directly dumps the contents of a path into the current file. Next up is
implementing that.
