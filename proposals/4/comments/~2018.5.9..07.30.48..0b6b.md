I've finally found time to read this UP carefully.  Random thoughts: (1) I love the longer face names.  On a related note, the code above is beautiful and easy to follow, imo.  (2)  Perhaps I'm newly color-blind, but the graphs don't look blue and gray to me!  I see green and white.  I presume green is for "blue" and white is for "gray".  (3) ~rovnys pointed out to me that that graphs are shown in the wrong order!  This initially confused me, but tbh I wasn't reading carefully enough when I looked at it however long ago.  (4)  I'm excited to get the new ford.  Thanks for your work guys!
