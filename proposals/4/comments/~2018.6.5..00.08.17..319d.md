## `~littel-ponnys`
I fixed a performance issue in `%turbo`'s wrapped scry implementation. It was calling `+hard` on incoming data...which could include the entire kernel. I ported the way old ford handled this. Running `+ls %` is no longer multiple orders of magnitude slower with `%turbo` and is now roughly as fast as old Ford.

I implemented `|mass`. We might want to tweak which pieces of data get reported, but the reporting pathway is now implemented and isn't just a `!!` in the vane.

Finally, I started looking at porting other vanes to use `%turbo` instead of `%ford`. I started looking at how `%eyre` worked internally, but decided its dephash handling is rather gnarly. `%gall` looks much simpler and I intend to work on porting it off old `%ford` tomorrow.
