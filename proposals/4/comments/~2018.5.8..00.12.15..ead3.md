## `~littel-ponnys`
Today I committed most of the things I worked on last week: I put in a testing fix so that we actually used the right ordering `[expected actual]` for our test results and fixed the issue where `%scry`s were blocked on resources instead of full `+scry-request`s with `+beam`s.

I also fixed the `+five-oh-cache-reclamation` case so that it's resilient to either of its valid test results; the test results can vary based on the spacing in the hoon file which defines the tests. I got halfway through implementing the `%call` schematic; I have a [WIP branch](https://github.com/eglaysher/arvo/commit/768ced85d1de1801029a20d67e9ff70b3d91d47b).
