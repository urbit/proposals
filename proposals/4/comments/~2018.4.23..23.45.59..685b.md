## `~littel-ponnys`
Good News, Everyone!

We've completed implementing the %alts schematic, which has shaken out several problems with how we track dependencies. After this morning, all of the details of ~rovnys' proposal on tracking provisional sub-builds are completed and debugged. We believe this is the final piece of getting Ford's dependency tracking and rebuilding engine working. We've now finished building the "turbo" part of "ford-turbo".

As all tests now work, we are now back to publishing on the [ford-turbo branch](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/commit/2561a56d806a590a1495875c92005f788ddf0daf).

Next steps:

- A cleanup pass. While it works, it could be better organized and commented.

- Cache reclamation. This will test that Ford can deal with `%tombstone`d builds.

- Writing several additional really hard test cases to try our best to break this thing.

- Start writing integration tests against a live user-space copy of Clay. We've been testing Ford in isolation and we want to make sure that when we start using the real Clay, what we have will work.

- Implementing the remaining schematics.
