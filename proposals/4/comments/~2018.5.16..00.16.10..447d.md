## `~littel-ponnys`
~ponnys integrated crane parsing into `+hood`. We now use the full crane-aware
parser to parse hoon files that have Ford directives in it. Also worked on some
minor cleanup work around error handling.

~rovnys put together most of the first version of `+plan` that can link
together multiple libraries. Passing in a library with `/+` or `/-` should
work.

We also fixed a bug involving the order of `+build-receipt` processing in
`+reduce`.
