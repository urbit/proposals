I implemented the first step of the handler for the `%plan` schematic, as planned. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/b1e85d481ef99bc216406b8133a94d9f27fb36fc).

Next step will be to implement the `%path` schematic, which will allow me to handle library and structure imports in the `+scaffold` in `%plan`. In order to do this, I will need to assemble a subject containing libraries. After discussing with `~pittyp` and `~sorreg` I've decided to try to do it right, and ditch the ["reprocessed cheese"](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues/622) method of library inclusion in favor of a different method proposed by `~pittyp`. I'll make the subject a tuple of all the included libraries and structures, and each one will be wrapped in a face named after its filepath. This should recursively prevent internal faces or arms of a library from leaking into the namespace of the resulting subject.
