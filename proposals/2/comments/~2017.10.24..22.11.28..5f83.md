I don't think each vane should have a UP.  We shouldn't have perpetually open UPs, period. 
 Each UP should represent an achievable goal. Once that goal is achieved, the UP can be considered complete.

It might be useful to tags on UPs like the tags on our github issues, describing which pieces of the system are affected by the proposed change. This would be helpful for displaying a listing of all the projects currently in progress, which someone new to the system could use to determine what to work on next. Maybe part of the task tracker could be a high-level roadmap view, so you could check that and know what's done and what's next. The Meteor project has historically done a good job of this with their [trello-based roadmap](https://trello.com/b/hjBDflxp/old-meteor-roadmap-new-roadmap-at-https-githubcom-meteor-meteor-blob-devel-roadmapmd), which has since been moved to a github page for some reason: https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/Roadmap.md

As for known non-starters, I think those belong in design documents, which we should have more of. I suspect Rich Hickey is right about the purpose of a design document being partially to log the reasons other designs were _not_ pursued. The "Rationale" section of UPs would also be a good place for that information.
