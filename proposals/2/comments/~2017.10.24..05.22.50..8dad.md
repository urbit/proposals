While we were working on UP0 we talked a lot about different options for formalizing the task-management part of any in-progress UP. If an UP is actually going to turn into real, working code this is clearly needed. My thinking was that this should just start as a text list in a post, and that we'll figure out task tracking later.

Your suggestion of using GH project boards makes sense to me. As you mention, it'd be great to use Urbit itself for this â€” but it's too early. But, ultimately, we can probably agree that GH boards are an interim solution. That's the main reason we didn't specify this in UP0. 

As far as the spirit of an UP is concerned, I feel like this should end up as an evolving set of guidelines on how an integration plan should turn into a set of tasks. In my mind an UP can evolve continuously. Does anyone disagree with that? In my mind UP2 could just be continuously updated with the current task tracking recommendation.

Or is that not quite the right way to do this?
