We now [have a test case for the Five-oh-fora error](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/commit/4a62502074e499ec75b82d202b7f6d48db7453a2) and have committed it to the main ford-turbo branch. We fixed a bunch of bugs in the dependency tracking and rebuild logic and now Ford passes this test case!

In it, we build a simulacrum of a simple "site" with two source posts and a shared sidebar. Each source post is a pair (autocons) of its title and its post contents. We build a sidebar which is the pair of titles. We then subscribe to both "output posts" which contain both the side bar and the current post. We then update the contents but not the title of one of the posts and ensure that we don't update other pages which use the sidebar. 

From here, we think we have a few remaining problems with the dependency tracking which we're going to focus on next. We wrote a test case for the `%alts` schematic and currently it is not canceling one of the clay subscriptions properly. That work is in a [WIP branch](https://github.com/eglaysher/arvo/commit/39f04f59bf0d56136d5793dafec050575cd9751b) for now.
