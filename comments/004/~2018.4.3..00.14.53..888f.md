## `~ponnys-podfer`
We fixed a conflict where a live build and a once build depend on the same file on the filesystem. 

We implemented the `%slim` schematic, including tests, and have started work on the `%ride` schematic. Once we have `%ride`, we should have enough schematics to test that our current caching algorithm will fix the "Five-oh-fora" error.

We wrote `+result-to-cage` in preparation for implementing `%ride`. `~rovnys` thinks this is fine, but I'm uncertain that we'll always want a `+cage` instead of a `+vase`. Either way, it's fine for now.
