## `~littel-ponnys`
~littel-ponnys got enough of `%walk` working that it can now
calculate the path through a mark graph of two nodes, where one
mark has a `+grab` arm and the other has a `+grow` arm. While
theoretically, the full breadth-first graph search should Just
Work[tm] for larger cases, we want to extensively test this
before we declare victory. [Current WIP](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/commit/9b6faefd50d1b1686d28e2d3e523786c9fbd95e8).

~rovnys-ricfer got the cachce working and passing the entire test
suite. Along the way, he fixed a bunch of listener bugs where we
weren't updating state correctly. This is the cache where we hold
on to completed root builds in an LRU cache. We attempted to
merge his code with ~littel-ponnys, and we believe we now have a
ship that has successfully booted with Ford-turbo with cache,
though we need to do more smoke testing before we push this to
master.
