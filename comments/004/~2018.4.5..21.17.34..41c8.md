## `~rovnys-ricfer`
We have now tested `%ride` with blocking scry and succeeding scry. We ended up changing the design to unify the local scry results with the real scry namespace instead of making a `%scry` sub-build for every attempt at a scry. This new design will only make a sub-build for a scry that blocked.

This work is on the ford-turbo branch of the main Arvo repo.
