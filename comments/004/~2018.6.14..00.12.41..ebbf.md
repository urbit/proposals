## `~rosfyl-sammeb-boltun-radwex--fannec-dabsub-binwyd-dopzod`
Today we cleaned up the accumulated porting of Gall and Gall apps to Ford-turbo onto the main `ford-turbo` branch. There is no longer a `dontjo`; the changes to use Ford-turbo our now in the main `dojo` app.

We also made progress on the redesign of how we're going to do dependency tracking when we have builds which aren't currently live. [Current WIP](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/commit/b5b64ed317310500f8e184ace6ec77405057ddd4).
