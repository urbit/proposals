## `~littel-ponnys`
~ponnys got some limited rendering using Eyre and Ford-turbo today! At least
the front page of the current collections app now renders using
Ford-turbo. This involved some changes to the collections app to remove
deprecated patterns that Ford-turbo won't support, some changes to Eyre to
actually use Ford-turbo, and fixed to Ford-turbo itself where it was doing The
Wrong Thing. (`%bake` needed to fallback to marks if a renderer didn't succeed,
the `%grow` schematic needed to `%bunt` the target mark instead of the source
mark, etc.)

~rovnys went back to working on caching. He added another test to exercise the
caching but unfortunately it passed, so it didn't shine a light on why we are
crashing on boot. We are now back to adding more printfs to the boot.
