## `~littel-ponnys`
After playing with Clay, it's clear that we actually do need to implement the full mark graph searching behavior for mark translation. So ~little-ponnys started looking at implementing a separate `%walk` schematic which only finds the conversion path between two marks. We make this a schematic so we don't have to repeatedly solve the traveling salesman problem and can just use a cached result.

~rovnys-ricfer continued working on the caching implementation. He got about a third of the tests passing with the new system and is continuing to debug. [Current WIP](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/commit/c4663a38d2d7fac25fe64955d8fdbb02652c376a).

Eventually, we think we will reorganize ford's state, replacing lots of secondary indices with an explicit state machine per build. Here's [our long term sketch](https://gist.github.com/belisarius222/c56b1d1227e787adca22042f27b57404).
