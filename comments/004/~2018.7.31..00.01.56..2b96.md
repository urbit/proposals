## `~littel-ponnys`
Today, ~ponnys started looking at porting Eyre over to Ford-turbo. He got some
basic integration done, to the point that error messages are being delivered
from Ford-turbo to the browser. Current ongoing work is finding all the places
where `tree` doesn't compile with Ford-turbo. For instance, we no longer have
`/%` or `/#`, so those need to be removed. Likewise, `tree` references marks
which don't have an existing mark file, which is another thing that will have
to be fixed.

Meanwhile, ~rovnys worked on testing our cache wiping, along with working with
~fodwyt on compiler performance. (Changing how we did linking in Hoon has
caused a serious boot time performance regression that needs to be addressed.)
