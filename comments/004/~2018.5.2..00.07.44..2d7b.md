## `~littel-ponnys`
~rovnys has a version of cache reclamation pushed to the main ford-turbo branch now.

I have a [test app](https://github.com/eglaysher/arvo/blob/759cc9cc7d7f9f896123384853b6b226760b459b/app/ford-turbo.hoon) now which is able to take a wrapped ford-turbo instance, translate moves from it to real clay and back; this shook out some bugs with path handling. ford-turbo is currently crashing on handling of `%ud` cases that it's getting back from the real clay.

On a lark, I copied the five-oh-fora test case and stuck a cache reclamation pass in the center. Everything still worked, which is a good sign that ~rovnys' cache reclamation algorithm works in more complex cases.
