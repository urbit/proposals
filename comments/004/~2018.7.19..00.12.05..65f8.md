## `~littel-ponnys`
Today, we got tests passing up through `+test-ride-scry-promote`. This means
the new design passes 34 tests passing so far! We're now working on getting
`+test-five-oh-fora` working, which exercises a lot of our subscription
logic. (We'll also need something to track which duct started a scry-request.)
