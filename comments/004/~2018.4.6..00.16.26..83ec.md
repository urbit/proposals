## `~rovnys-ricfer`
We build the fora test case and tried to run it. In doing so, we discovered a bug in the cache promotion algorithm as implemented.

If you make a second request for a live build that has sub-builds, `+execute` does not properly promote the previous results. When it checks for whether any sub-builds have changed since the last build, it doesn't rerun sub-builds that have not yet been rebuilt at the new date. Because of this, if any sub-builds haven't been rebuilt at this new date, it assumes the build has changed and we won't be able to promote its cached result.

Instead, we should recurse downward into the sub-builds, which will promote their results if possible. Then check whether all the sub-builds have the same results as previously. That way we can avoid rerunning `+make` in the unchanged case.

We now have a simple failing test case that reproduces the issue. We also have a failing fora test case. Tomorrow we will attempt to rectify both of these.
