## `~littel-ponnys`
~ponnys got Eyre using Ford-turbo for building and running security drivers. It
still relies on the previous Ford for everything else, including building the
content for serving.

~rovnys finished the [first pass at
caching](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/commit/56c8f49966e1146a7ac8e28a815fafcd88c1bc9d). All
the tests pass! But we tried to boot a new fakezod off of it. It crashed, but only
at the very end of the build.
