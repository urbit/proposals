~rovnys finished implementing the `%diff`, `%join`, and `%pact` schematics. Now all schematics and Ford runes are implemented and have at least basic testing.

The next phase of the project will be to load ford-turbo into the kernel as a new vane alongside existing Ford and move the call sites in other vanes over to ford-turbo one by one. We might do some cleanup or more testing before that, or we might jump straight into it.
