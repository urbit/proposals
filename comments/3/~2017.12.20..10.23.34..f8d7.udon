~fyr,

So should  the login facilities should be kept independent of the serving desk?
Obviously `/blog` desk should not affect my ability 
to use `portal`. How should I go about actually implementing it. 

In eyre there is
```
top/beam
```

which I presume is what |serve modifies. 

After we extricate all that stuff from eyre, there still needs to be a way to 
to point eyre there. If it is to be independent of a serving deck, then one option (I think inferior to the one below) is to have another default path `portal/beam` containing entry point for default login website

On the other hand, I feel this could impact eyre in ways I don't know yet. 

Another, perhaps better solution is to have hardcoded/settable path _inside current deck_. 
After all, when someone does `merge %desk /home`, it will still pull in the default portal, 
so there will be no problem. This also gives a nice app integration. If someone is developing particular user-facing service, they can easily modify the styling/function of portal for the overall uniformity without impacting their default login portal. Say someone is developing 
game. They will definetely want the default welcome page to be consistent with their overall styling. Or imagine a corporate system running on Urbit with customized login service (Even providing token authentication through browser APIs!). I think there are a lot of usecases which warrant that.
