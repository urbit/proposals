Go for it!

To cover the rationale for pieces of the current design, I believe now all outdated:
- the compiled-in js, html, and favicon are intended to be independent from clay, and in particular which desk the frontend is being served from. However, authenticated requests only really have any effect when hitting a ford page in the first place; and on headless JSON API interactions, but those can use the `/~/auth.json` `GET/POST` endpoint directly as you mention.
- poll.js in particular would ideally not be built by a ford request, as it is included on ford error pages and should resolve even when arbitrary ford requests are erroring out - but "arbitrary ford requests are erroring out" is a bit of an edge case, and not worth the architectural complication
- auth.js, poll.js, and urb.js are kept separate so that in theory the frontend would not have to pull in RPC code except unless actually communicating with apps, and auth code except when logging in. This separation can be done just as well in userspace, and also at the moment all three are always pulled in anyway
- and the `urb` mark extends the poll code considerably, eyre ++poll:js and mar/urb/wasp-data.js should just be combined into a single script
