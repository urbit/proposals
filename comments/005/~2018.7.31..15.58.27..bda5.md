We have a purely functional programming language, and so have type information for events that you can leverage. A poke to a vane (or app!) can be statically analyzed to only touch axises xyz, and so you can schedule disjointed events with that without having to mark dirty bits for subtrees. Like you said, though, I'm not sure how useful it'd actually be when there's a lot of axis overlap for common events, and .^ might break something.

Seems like there's two motivations for this: making urbit Not Slow(tm) and giving programmers parallelization primitives. A ford parallel build event is the latter, but wouldn't speed up dojo any. Disjointed event scheduling would speed up the former, but then you have the same level of explicit parallelization that we have currently (read: none).

Something like a promise system might work for Hoon too. Be able to construct n values that split off computation in the background, and only join when they have to be read. We construct a lot of expensive values that aren't actually immediately needed. I'm not sure if the event log would ruin all the utility though, since it'd try to collect everything when the event ends and you can't schedule an event before the last one finishes.
