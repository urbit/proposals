I have a bad feeling about updating UPs continuously to mirror a task tracker. It seems like an unnecessary coupling of concerns that will end up taking time to maintain without providing much extra benefit over just having a task tracker.

Ideally, tracking the state of projects should happen in one place, and that place should be a task tracker (quite possibly github's project board). It's not a bad idea to organize lists of tasks by UP inside of that task tracker, but I don't think that state belongs in the document itself.

We should be able to modify a UP, but only to change the plan, not its state of development.
