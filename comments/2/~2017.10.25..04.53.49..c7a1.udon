I think, after thinking about it, it's easier to think about an UP as a finite project. The vane case actually makes that particularly clear. We want to add features to vanes, but it's hard to think about their perfect final state in a complete way. It's much more realistic to think in terms of individual improvements.

With that in mind, I'd say simply linking to a project board from an UP is probably sufficient. It could go in metadata, but I feel like it should simply go in the integration section. The project board is really just an interim tool for tracking. 

As far as adding 'status' and 'type' fields, it *sounds* good â€” but what actually goes in them? Is status 'accepted', 'pending' or 'rejected'? What are the 'type' values?
