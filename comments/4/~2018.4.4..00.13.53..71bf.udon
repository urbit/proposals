## `~rovnys-ricfer`
We worked on the `%ride` schematic today. Most of the work today focused on writing `+intercepted-scry`, which looks like a real scry but only resolves paths for which Ford has already calculated results. The `%ride` handler then creates sub-builds for each blocked path.

None of this is tested, so until it is, it'll live in the [ford-turbo-wip branch](https://github.com/belisarius222/arvo/tree/0f1409ab597dddc01ecf60937311d0b3b0ff8b84).
