## `~littel-ponnys`
Today, I fixed an issue in our handling of provisional builds, and simplified
things quite a bit. We had a confusing `:clear-sub-builds` flag on
`+build-receipt`s which let a build signal that all its dependencies should be
cleared. This was unnecessary as the provisional build tracking could handle
this sans one bug which I fixed today. What happened was that we were trying to
remove listeners before we removed our provisional linkages...which meant that
are attempts to remove listeners were always a no-op.

This fixed the `+test-call-scry-varies` case which I've been working on. This
is the first case which has a `%scry` which varies by its input elements. The
case will run:

```
|=  a=@da
.^(@tas /~nul/desk/(scot %da a)/result)
```

Where the date passed `:a` is the contents of a clay file.

It also let me remove `:clear-sub-builds` from our interface, which was a
really nice cleanup since it was overly complex.

I started on the final pieces of the `:ford-turbo` gall app; everything works
except that it relies on a direct scry which won't work when we run it as a
vane. ~rovnys thinks the correct answer here is to just modify clay's `%wris`
to return one of the new `+cass` structures (`[ud/@ud da/@da]`) instead of a
normal `+case`. There are weird timing issues if we try to send a separate
request.
