## `~littel-ponnys`
Today, ~littel-ponnys did some refactoring work which cleaned up a common
pattern where we depended on several builds, handled errors and build blocking,
and then did something with the results. This pattern was copy-pasted several
times in the various `+make` arms; there is now one function call for this.

In addition to that, he finished the rework of `%walk` so that it doesn't load
literally every mark on a desk. As expected, this is _much_ faster. After that,
the `%cast`-using-`%walk` patch got merged. We previously couldn't merge that
patch because the old `%walk` made the commit from Unix take a literal minute.

~rovnys-ricfer continues to work on caching and is _this_ close to moving to a
state machine model. [Current WIP](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/commit/41086ae1eb6bd9ab71e6a3f64e2f3729925b081c).
