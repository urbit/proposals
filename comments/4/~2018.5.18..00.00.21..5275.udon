## `~littel-ponnys`
We now have several `+crane`s executing. We now properly deal with `/~`, `/=`,
`/.`, `/^` and `/;` at the top of hoon files. Here are example test cases that
we correctly execute:

```
/=  one  /~  `@u`1
/=  two  /~  `@u`2
(add one two)
```

```
/=  data  /^  (list @ud)
          /.  /~  1
              /~  2
              /~  3
              ==
(weld data [4 5 ~])
```

```
/=  data  /;  |=(a=@u [a a ~])
          /~  5
data
```
