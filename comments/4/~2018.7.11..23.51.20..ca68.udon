## `~littel-ponnys`
We re-re-redesigned ford.

We want rebuilds and promotions to happen per-duct and this necessitated more
state changes. The good news is the state is somewhat smaller and the overall
system should be easier to reason about.

The bad news is that this is another rewrite. During a rewrite. We're trying to
decrease our yak depth because we only have so many razors. Expect a write-up
soon.
