## `~littel-ponnys`
Today, we did miscellaneous cleanup. We fixed `|mass`, added `%wipe` and
`%keep` commands to Ford, integrated a new `+by` (map) function which does in
place mutation (so we aren't doing multiple lookups and potential tree
rebalancings), and added profiling hints.

After profiling, we noticed that parsing hoon was a bit slow. We thought we
could speed things up by caching the parsing so we added a `+cache-key` for it.

Finally, we started hardened Ford against bad user-written marks. We found one
place where a mark could just crash a pipeline, and we'll have to do much more
of this.

Next, we intend to work on the quality of the error messages.
