## `~littel-ponnys`
~ponnys upstreamed [a previous patch related to
%peer-invisible](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/commit/a49e9363538e9d2902645ac49748e42f5dc7ef3e),
sent a [PR which removes the `/%` rune in
collections](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/809) and continued work on the
new Eyre design document.

~rovnys worked with ~davtyr-nimren on collections. They think they've [solved
the blocking clay bugs](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/810) enough to merge
the collections branch into release-candidate!
