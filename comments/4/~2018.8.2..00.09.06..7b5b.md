## `~littel-ponnys`
~ponnys has been trying to integrate the collections code into the ford-turbo
branch. Instead of trying to get old `tree` working, we're just going to move
directly to collections. The collections code works when Eyre uses old Ford,
but breaks in weird ways when even just the final casting is done. Also fixed a
bug related to being unable to scry into ames from a generator, which is needed
for the `+code` generator to work.

~rovnys and ~fodwyt worked on profiling the compiler to try to figure out why
doing linking the old (incorrect) way is 31 times faster than linking files
correctly. This is super important so we can actually make pills; our cycle
iteration time is way too high!
