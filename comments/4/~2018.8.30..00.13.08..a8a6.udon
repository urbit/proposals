## `~littel-ponnys`
~ponnys merged with ~master-morzod's rework of the `:acme` app, changing
`+expect-eq` so that it's easier to read and also performs nest checking. Now
[all the tests in the system](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/791) are in
the standard `+test` framework! He then went and [simplified including the test
libraries](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/794). Previously, you had to make
your test core a door with a specific context, while now you can just import a
library and use a normal core.

~rovnys [wrote an expectation function for ford
schematics](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/793), which is needed for his
current clay unit tests.
