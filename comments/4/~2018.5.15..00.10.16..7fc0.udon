## `~littel-ponnys`
~ponnys finished implementing the crane parsers. We should theoretically be
able to parse any hoon file that old ford could parse, even though we can't yet
build the files.

~rovnys finished his redesign of `%reef`, where the kernel created is now
usually referentially transparent. It's much better than the previous
implementation, which just passed the kernel back as passed to it. It isn't
referentially transparent when the user has `|autoload` turned off.
