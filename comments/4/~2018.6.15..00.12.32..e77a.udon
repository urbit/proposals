Today, ~rovnys fixed the treap ordering in the cache. He also fixed the test framework to use the new `%keep` task to clear the ford cache at the end of each test, so that we can continue to assert that we're cleaning up everything. ~ponnys converted the outgoing call-sites in Clay to use Ford-turbo (responses are a work in progress, though).

We also discussed how we're going to promote the results of once builds. In `+gather-build`, when gathering a `%scry`, we need to know whether we can promote it or whether we have to rerun it. The second thing we have to know is after running a scry, do we need to subscribe to its resource to be notified about changes to the resource? Both of these require a persistent knowledge of whether that scry should be considered live or once. We're still figuring out how that works.
