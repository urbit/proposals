## `~littel-ponnys`
~ponnys started working on a new Eyre design document. Yesterday, he [fixed
security drivers in Eyre with
Ford-turbo](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/804) and [fixed a path issue in
dojo](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/805).

~rovnys [landed his PR to reduce Clay's violation of referential
transparency](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/807). This will hopefully
unblock the integration work with collections after we fix another collections
bug.
