## `~littel-ponnys`
Today was a day of writing test cases to shake out bugs. We wrote `+test-scry-live-again`, which showed a problem with two ducts on the same build. `+test-live-and-pinned-triangle` surfaced a problem with the promotion of pinned builds. We solved both of these bugs.

We also wrote a test case to try to test orphaned build promotion, but it passed. At the end of the day, we had [another WIP test case](https://github.com/eglaysher/arvo/commit/ce6f0e61c7186ee7646130c9000aa8f761fa27df) which doesn't yet clean up after itself (though we do send the correct mades).
