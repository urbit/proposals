## `~littel-ponnys`
Merge work continued for ~ponnys. We now have fixes to Eyre and several marks
used in collections so that you can now create a circle and post one message to
it. Figuring out why you can't post a second message shall have to wait until
tomorrow.

Meanwhile, ~rovnys worked on documentation. He wrote [a top-level overview of
Ford as a system along with additional per-function
comments](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/commit/32088aeb011546357cc91f023193876c3400c62b). We
are approaching the amount of documentation that we want to have on the system!
