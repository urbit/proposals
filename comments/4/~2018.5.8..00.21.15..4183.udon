I abandoned the ambifacient approach to fixing the `%pin` side-fumbling in favor of a simpler fix: have Ford stop lying about the formal date of `%pin` builds. We used to ignore the formal date of a `%pin` build in `+gather-build` and immediately replace it with the pinned date inside the schematic. When we stopped doing that, and instead had `+make` create a sub-build at the pinned time, the bugs went away.

After fixing that, I added the `pit=vase` argument to the ford-turbo library and used that in the tests, then used that to implement the `%reef` schematic, which produces a vase of the kernel (which is just `:pit` itself).

I'm starting to write the handler for the `%plan` schematic, which is the first one that deals with building Hoon files. The first pass will ignore library imports, Ford runes, and indirect hoons (imported through a `//`), and only deal with a stack of `+hoon`s (expressed as `%direct` `+brick`s). After that, I'll start filling in the rest of the features of a `%plan`, which will require implementing the `%path` schematic to canonicalize library import paths.
