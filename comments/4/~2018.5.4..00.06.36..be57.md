## `~littel-ponnys`
I worked on `%call` but ran into some issues around working with gate samples, so I'm deffering it for now.

I reviewed ~palfun's change to make %cw return a pair of the case number and the canonical date of a commit. From there, I merged it into my WIP branch, [ford-turbo-app](https://github.com/eglaysher/arvo/commit/bebf3eaf5a197f1aa55a90cab1a9fccea6a59273). Now that clay has a way to resolve case numbers to dates, used that to get subscriptions working. However, there's still a bug about resolving blocks which means that while we're now properly resubscribing to a real clay instance, we aren't properly producing `%made` moves in response to `%mult`.
