## `~littel-ponnys`
Today, I completed `%call` along with several basic test cases. I added a test case to ensure that `[[%pin ... [%scry ...]] [%pin ... [%scry ...]]]` works, where the `%scry`s point to the same resource, but the `%pin`s vary in time. This test was half written last week, and was what shook out the `%pin` problems ~rovnys has been working on, which are now fixed so that the test case can be committed. I did some fixes so the `%gall` app which tests integration between ford-turbo and `%clay` still works after ~rovnys' change to `pit=vase` at the top of ford-turbo.

I wrote a test case that put a scry inside a gate which got `%call`ed in a ford build step. It produced the correct `%made`s, but isn't properly cleaning up after itself, and I'll continue there tomorrow. WIP branch is [here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/commit/435e3b38f40a34d3d161f5c0ff4be7c5f21fd6bb).
