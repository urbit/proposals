## `~littel-ponnys`
Today we theoretically finished rewriting the `+gather` part of ford-turbo to
use the simpler data structures we're using. We changed how we represent
provisional linkages again since we realized that we also need to be able to
represent [provisional blocked
builds](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/7d9930f8ed53a5e81d845eb11f12c47f40fb76d5/sys/vane/turbo.hoon#L212-L240).

We actually were able to remove the `:rebuilds` data structure. We don't have
to explicitly link forwards and backwards between equivalent builds in time. We
can just check equality and we should be able to memoize that check without
storing extra state. This is another piece of state that we won't have to worry
about getting out of sync. We were also able to remove `+resource-updates` and
`+blocks` because this state is now stored per-build in the `+build-status`. We
further expect to be able to consolidate `+candidate-builds` and `+next-builds`
into a single data structure.

The next steps to rewrite `+reduce` and then try to compile it. We've gone
several days without trying to build this rewrite, so that should
be...interesting.
