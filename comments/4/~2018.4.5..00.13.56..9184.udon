## `~rovnys-ricfer`
We have an implementation of the `%ride` schematic now that compiles and passes a basic test. 

We have not yet tested handling of the case where the Hoon code in the `%ride` schematic performs a scry operation. When that happens, Ford will intercept any scry's, using only Ford's local results of `%scry` schematics as the namespace. Any other calls will block and will be turned into their own `%scry` sub-builds.

Testing that is up next.
