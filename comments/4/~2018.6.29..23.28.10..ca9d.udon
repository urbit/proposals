## `~littel-ponnys`
Today we refined the design by coalescing the three DAGs into one. We continued
our plan where we are going function by function in ford-turbo and rewriting to
use the new data structures.

One interesting thing to note is that we changed how we represent linkages. We
previously had separate mappings for dependencies, blocks and provisional
builds. ~rovnys made the observation that these three relations could be
tracked once: either a build relationship is provisional or it's real. If it's
real, it may or may not be blocked. Changing this means that there are now
invalid states in the old design that we can't represent with the new data
structures.
