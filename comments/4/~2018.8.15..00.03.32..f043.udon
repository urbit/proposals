## `~littel-ponnys`
Today we implemented our new caching system and have a fakezod booting with
it. We're caching the subset of the schematics mentioned yesterday.

The time to boot a fakezod from hitting enter on the Unix command to having a
dojo prompt is now one minute and twenty seconds, though this isn't yet
compiling `%hall` or `%talk`. There are very few cache hits during the initial
boot, though we are now using cached data when running the same generator
twice.

We also did a minor cleanup pass where we removed stale TODOs, deleted dead
code, and fixed code formatting.

All of this has been merged back to the main [ford-turbo
branch](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/ford-turbo).
